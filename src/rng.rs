//! A small seeded deterministic PRNG.
//!
//! [`SplitMix64`] is the standard 64-bit `SplitMix` generator from Vigna,
//! used here as the seed source for `IvfIndex`'s k-means++ initialization
//! and for deterministic subsampling of the training set. It is
//! intentionally hand-rolled and dependency-free so the determinism
//! contract — same `seed` + same training sample → identical centroids —
//! does not depend on an external crate's version drift.
//!
//! This mirrors the `SplitMix64` generator `iqdb-hnsw` uses, plus a
//! [`SplitMix64::next_below`] helper that k-means++ uses for unbiased
//! uniform integer draws. Keeping a local copy means `iqdb-ivf` does
//! not depend on `iqdb-hnsw`, which would otherwise pull a graph-index
//! crate in just to borrow eleven lines of mix function. Consolidating
//! `SplitMix64` into a shared utility crate is a possible future
//! cleanup tracked in `dev/ROADMAP.md`.
//!
//! The generator is not cryptographically secure and is not intended to
//! be. It is fast, has good enough distribution for the small floating
//! draws k-means++ makes, and produces the same byte sequence on every
//! platform.
